# vmware cds fetcher

really lazy script to get the latest version of workstation because broadcom
made it really annoying to download

this contains very messy code, please do not attempt to fix it the cds location
is sourced from the aur sources list

this is not meant for piracy, as workstation are now free for non-commercial
purposes

GOD FORBID BROADCAM MAKE USABLE DOWNLOAD PAGES
